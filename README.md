## 📊 Dataset

- **File:** `NIFTY50_all Sarthak.csv`  
- **Description:** Contains historical stock/index data for NIFTY50  
- Used for training, visualization, and forecasting  

---

## 📈 Methods Used

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Trend and seasonality detection  
- **Modeling:** ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, or similar forecasting methods  
- **Evaluation:** Metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE  
- **Visualization:** Line plots, decomposition plots, and correlation analysis
